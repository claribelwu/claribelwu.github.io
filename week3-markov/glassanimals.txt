Life Itself
Daddy was dumb said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar
I can't get a job so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar
I can't get a job so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Youth
Boy
When I left you you were young
I was gone but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war
All I want's you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy
Fly high
Feel your mother at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly high
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
Boy
Now your life is back to fun
But you see that's not for long
Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of the memory so warm
Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy
Fly high
Feel your mother at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly high
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy
Fly high
Feel your mother at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly high
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
I'll make you...
Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit...
"Season 2 Episode 3"
Don't you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
Baby, now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're moving forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it
Baby, now my body's in tatters
In an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
But lately I can't take it
Leftover breakfast, cereal for lunch
She is broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar when she's gettin' blazed
Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
Lazy, and lyin' on your belly
With a super pump cola
Lookin' at your folded clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster
Maybe, I wish I could mold ya
"The Very Cold and Colder"
But you couldn't step forward
So it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it
Leftover breakfast, cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar when she's gettin' blazed
She's drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad
Don't you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
Oh baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby, now my head is on backwards
Oh baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby, now my head is on backwards
Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
"Pork Soda"
Somewhere in South End when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead
(Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead)
Somebody said that I'm a fuckin' slum
Don’t know that I belong
Maybe you’re fucking dumb
Maybe I’m just a bum
Maybe you’re fucking scum
Don’t you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time
Pineapples are in my head
(when you were fun)
Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead
(you made me run)
Pineapples are in my head
(to the seafront)
Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead
(she took the plunge)
5000 footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms around my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won’t forget how you looked at me then
I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times when we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don't I say it then?
I want you all the time
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead
(Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead
(Got nobody 'cos I’m brain dead)
Mama's Gun
In the summer
Took my gun
And made him go to Neverland
He was something
My old husband
He was all you'd ever want
Did you say somethin'
What'd you say?
Was that your voice or was that me?
Little voices buzzin poison
Backward noise drom everything
Dr Swango
Says I'm psycho
Says they all from Neverland
They'll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me?
Dirty Dustin
Said he saw him
Playin' ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim
Had never spoken
Whispered back "You murdered him."
My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull they stretch infinitely
In the summer silence
I was getting violent
In the summer silence
I was doing nothing
Play with me my love
In the summer sun
I'll be waiting it
Your favorite Cheshire grin
Lay with me my dear
In the evening clear
I'll be dreaming in
My paper pale skin
In the summer silence
I was getting violent
In the summer silence
I was doing nothing
Cane Shuga
Baby, don't go
I'll stop breathing coke
No more bloody nose
No more John Does
Steam rolled hair
Look into the glare and pop it brother
Slick like 007 man
You fly like Kim Jong rockets [x4]
Burn through my love
Just like your drugs
I've had quite enough
Or lack thereof
Steam rolled hair
Look into the glare and pop it brother
Slick like 007 man
You fly like Kim Jong rockets [x2]
Steam rolled hair
Look into the glare and pop it brother
Slick like 007 man
You fly like Kim Jong rockets...
[Premade Sandwiches]
People standing in line to look at pre made sandwiches
People standing in line to get high to 'bad bitches'
People standing in line to smoke weed that's green tea
People standing in line for two rails of oxiclean
People standing in line to nuke themselves with ketamine
It's artisan raw and gluten free
Probiotic superfood antioxidant low msg
Non GMO locally sourced quinoa and chia seeds
Jojoba and baobab dog treats
Hand made with wild goji berries
Agave, acai and activated whey protein
People standing in line to buy whatever the McFuck they might
Want to shove down their foodpipes tonight
New watch in black gold
New shirt that looks old
Big dick and no soul
New pants with four holes
Old phones in one drawer
Five dry pens something from a kinder egg
And everything you didn't know you were looking for
People complaining cos' their mum whines
People complaining about losing their minds
People complaining about standing in line
People standing in line and they don't even know why
The Other Side Of Paradise
When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me please don't worry
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one way ticket
Out west that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwan
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion
Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Superparadise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
When I was from n.o.l.a no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him don't you blame me
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dreams
I know you don't but I
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Superparadise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
Take A Slice
Yes the candle yo, it's a sausage, sausage candle
Most people don't do it the way I do it very personal
Selling [?] the money
Twenties, twenties, Twenties
Y'know like whatever, I just tought sausage
I don't ever wanna pick a slice
One is pretty but the other lies
Chewing on a fat smoke
No filter but you're puffing
Suckin' on a slim vogue
Dark Fingernail polish
I'm the treasure baby I'm the prize
Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
Shitty old pistola
Shot a bullet thru my wallet
Gonna go to Pensacola
Gonna fuck my way through college
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cos you live in my day dreams
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cos you live in my day dreams
Sitting pretty in the prime of life
I'm so tasty and the price is right
Stewing in the black dope
I'm filthy and I love it
Studebacker all gold
Got a shotgun in my pocket
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cos you live in my day dreams
Poplar St.
When I was a boy I lived on Poplar St
Just a little child with plasters on my knees
Watching all the world from high up in the trees
I saw Mrs Moore sleep around with Mr Keats
I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah
Mama always called that woman prosti-tits
For wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick
One night Mrs Moore she made her eyes at me
Pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep
I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah
And all your days are gone
Sitting on the floor
In your underwear
Begging me for more
And all my days are gone
Sitting on the floor
In my underwear
Begging you for more
'Cause I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah
Just another boy who lived on Poplar St
Tangled up in lust and her exotic needs
One night Mrs Moore she called collect to me
I don't love you anymore she said and ceased to be
Agnes
Agnes just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now stop and breathe a second
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head
Your head is so numb
That nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions
That trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes
A choking rose back
To be reborn
I want to hold you like you're mine
You see the sad in everything a
Genius of love and loneliness and
This time you overdid the liquor
This time you pulled the fuckin' trigger
These days you're rolling all the time
So low so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion dollar smile?
Guess life is long
When soaked in sadness
On borrowed time
From Mr Madness
And so it goes
A choking rose back
To be reborn
I want to hold you like you're mine
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
